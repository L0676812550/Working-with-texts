            <h2>How computer games encourage kids to spend cash</h2>

            <!--Add picture with text-->

            <p>By Katherine Latham
            Business reporter</p>

            <h3>Nara Ward says keeping track of her kids' spending when they are playing their favourite computer games is a full-time
            job.</h3>

            <p>Ms Ward lives in Barbados with her husband and sons, Finn, 14, and Leif, 12.</p>
            <p>When Leif started playing Roblox, he began asking for robux - the game's currency - that allows players to upgrade their
            character or buy virtual items. So his grandparents gave him $200 (£159) Apple credit for Christmas.</p>
            <p>"To my shock, he spent all of it in a matter of days," says Ms Ward. "After that, I gave him no more than $10 worth of
            robux per month. He quickly became frustrated and bored with the game."</p>
            <p>Leif moved on to World of Tanks, which also requires players to upgrade their weaponry using PlayStation credit.</p>
            <p>"However, this game has the option to watch ads to gain credit," says Ms Ward. "He would do that out of desperation when
            he had used up his monthly gaming allowance."</p>
            <p>Ms Ward says her younger son has yet to learn self-control or money-sense.</p>
            <p>"It's something that I have to police constantly."</p>
            
            <!--Add picture with text-->

            <p>Rather than profiting from the initial sale of a video game, many of today's gaming companies rely on revenue generated
            by in-game purchases, or microtransactions.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, in-game purchases can provide a tactical advantage to the gameplay - extra lives, character upgrades or
            weapons - providing a lead over players who did not purchase the additional content.</p>
            
            <p>The global online microtransaction market is forecast to grow from $67.94bn in 2022 to $76.66bn in 2023.</p>
            
            <p>However, there are signs of a backlash from experts and consumers alike. Also, some companies are promising new releases
            that are in-game purchase-free.</p>

            <!--Add picture with text-->

            <p>Sarah Loya's son Andrew, 14, spends almost all his pocket money on gaming but, she says, that isn't a problem and gaming
            makes him happy.</p>
            
            <p>"He plays daily, after school and on the weekends. I don't really see much of a negative. He's a smart kid and knows the
            difference between reality and fantasy."</p>
            
            <p>Ms Loya lives in Texas with Andrew, and his brother Rex, 6.</p>
            
            <p>"My bank account is linked to Andrew's subscription, so I would see if he purchased something without permission," says
            the 43-year-old, "but he always asks me before making a purchase."</p>
